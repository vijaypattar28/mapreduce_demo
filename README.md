# mapreduce_demo
The technique works by first dividing up a large dataset and distributing the data across a cluster. In the map step, each data is analyzed and converted into a (key, value) pair. Then these key-value pairs are shuffled across the cluster so that all keys are on the same machine. In the reduce step, the values with the same keys are combined together.
